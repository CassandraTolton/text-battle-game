The inventory takes you to a seperate screen when you can see your list of options. There are no items that will be added during the duration of the game and you can only use three items.
1. Potion - Adds 20 hp to the main characters health pool
2. Torch - This can be used to either initate a fight or skip a fight, depending on the encounter.
3. Food - this adds +1 to the damage of each attack (Note: on hit is not effected by this stat, on the damage.)
4. Water - this allows you to have two attacks in one turn.
